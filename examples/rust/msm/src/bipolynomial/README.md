# Bivariate Polynomials



TODO -> 2D-FFT/IFFT for evaluation/interpolation. operator overloading for ADD, NEG, SUB and MUL. based on above Div operation is not possible for general cases and only possible for degree 1 binomials. If needed we can search more on Grobner basis but the remainder is not deterministic if 2 polynomials don't have bezout identity.
